# Homework1

## We were given the task of updating provided HTML code, which was rather messy and hard to follow, for clearer reading and SEO best practices using semantic tags. We were also to deploy our website using GitPages so that our website will go live.

### I updated the title tag to contain information on the company as well as keywords

### I added a meta tag within the head tag to provide more information on the company as well as keywords (to show up on search engines under the title tag but not displayed on the site)

### I created a header tag

### I created a nav tag within the header tag

### I created a figure tag and figcaption tag for the hero image

### I added alt tags to all images 

### There were a ton of divs, so I changed these to more semantic HTML tags wherever applicable

### I added a main tag for the main part of the page 

### I added section tags within the main tag

### I added an aside tag for the additional information provided on the right side of the page. 

### I added section tags within the aside tags

### I created a footer using the footer tag
